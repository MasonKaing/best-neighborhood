    "These three metrics impact the quality of life and community well-being of the neighborhood. Cleanliness serves as an indicator of how well-maintained and cared for a neighborhood is. It shows the community pride and services, which can influence property values. Arrest counts provide a look into public safety and crime levels in the neighborhoods. Neighborhoods with fewer arrests typically offer residents a greater sense of safety and a better environment for families and individuals. Average air pollution measures environmental health, which could affect an individual's health. Together, these metrics allow us to see a neighborhood's livability. \n",
