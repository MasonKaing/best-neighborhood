It shows the community pride and services, which can influence property values. Arrest counts provide a look into public safety and crime levels in the neighborhoods. Neighborhoods with fewer arrests typically offer residents a greater sense of safety and a better environment for families and individuals. Average air pollution measures environmental health, which could affect an individual's health. Together, these metrics allow us to see a neighborhood's livability. \n",
